      <h2>Global Warming</h2>
      <p>Global warming is a long-term increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. It is primarily caused by the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, from human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heat waves, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires.</p>
